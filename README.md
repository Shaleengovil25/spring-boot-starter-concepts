## Pre-knowledge

In microservices, a bounded context is a conceptual boundary that defines where a specific domain model is valid and applicable, helping to organize complex systems into manageable, autonomous pieces where each microservice operates within its own context. 
Bounded contexts are a core concept in Domain-Driven Design (DDD), a software development approach that emphasizes understanding the domain to build better software.
